Juno Eclipse: The Infinite Nexus Sabotage

A single-player (or Vs. AI) Cards Against Humanity-style narrative game set in the chaotic, crossover universe of Juno Eclipse. You are tasked with resolving multiversal crises by combining high-stakes missions (Black Cards) with absurd, often non-canonical solutions (White Cards). Your goal is to maximize Rebel Standing and sabotage the timeline just enough without causing a total Temporal Paradox.

Core Gameplay: Cause and Effect

The game revolves around Chapters (turns). Each Chapter presents a new Black Cardâ€”a mission that requires a specific number of White Cards to fill in the blank(s).

Black Card (The Crisis): A prompt involving major sci-fi franchises (Star Wars, Star Trek, Mass Effect, Doctor Who, Stargate, etc.) and requiring a chaotic solution.

White Card (The Solution): A card from your hand, rated by its Absurdity (1-5) and its Theme (e.g., SW, ST, ME, WHO).

Submission & Outcome: When you play a card, the game calculates the Average Absurdity of your solution and checks for Theme Synergy with the Black Card's core lore.

The outcome is always chaotic:

High Absurdity (4.0+): Risks high Stability loss but offers the highest potential for Rebel Standing gains.

Low Absurdity (under 2.5): Considered "too canon" and often results in heavy Hull Integrity damage as the mission is easily countered.

Theme Synergy: Matching a White Card's theme (e.g., a 'SW' card for a Star Wars Black Card) grants a bonus to Rebel Standing.

Key Stats & Failure Conditions

Your success is measured by managing four critical resources. If any of the failure conditions are met, the campaign ends.

Stat

Goal

Failure Condition

Rebel Standing

Maximize

Drops to 10 or below. (Loss of credibility/authority)

Hull Integrity

Maintain

Drops to 0%. (Physical destruction of your ship)

Temporal Stability

Maintain

Drops to 0%. (Timeline paradox erases you)

Game Modes

Solo Mode: Your goal is to survive as many chapters as possible while keeping all three core stats above the failure thresholds.

Vs. Computer Mode: You compete directly against The Nexus AI. The player who submits the card combination with the higher Average Absurdity wins the chapter, inflicting health and stability penalties on the loser. Goal: Defeat the Nexus AI's stats before it defeats yours!
